# tao-extension-release

This tool automates TAO extension release

## Installation

Please verify installation [prerequisite](#prerequisite). And run :

```sh
npm i -g @oat-sa/tao-extension-release
```

## Release

This tool offers specialized release process for different types of repositories.

### TAO extensions

If the repository contains a TAO Extension, please use the command `extensionRelease`.

```sh
taoRelease extensionRelease
```

You will be prompted to follow the instructions.

This command does:

- compute the next version from commits
- bundle assets
- create a tag and a release

### NPM packages

If the repository contains an npm package, please use the command `npmRelease`. This command _must_ be run in the root directory of an npm package repository.

```sh
cd path/to/my/package/repo
taoRelease npmRelease
```

You will be prompted to follow the instructions.

This command does:

- compute the next version from commits
- update the package.json and package-lock.json
- create a tag and a release
- publish the package to npm

At then end, you will be prompted to trigger the execution of `npm publish`. The Github release is already finished at this stage. If the publish step fails, you can try again manually, or ask someone with the necessary privileges to perform the publishing.


### NPM packages in monorepo

If the repository is a _lerna_-managed monorepo, and contains npm packages, please use the command `npmReleaseMonorepo`. This command _must_ be run in the root directory of the monorepo. Monorepo must be have `lerna` installed at the root, because release tool will use its CLI to get infromation about packages.

```sh
cd path/to/my/package/repo
taoRelease npmReleaseMonorepo
```

This command does:

- compute the next version from commits
    - for root, and for each package. Based on commits that touch files in this package.
- update the package.json and package-lock.json
   - for root, and for each package
- create a tag and a release
- publish the packages to npm
    - the Github release is already finished at this stage. If the publish step fails, you can try again manually, or ask someone with the necessary privileges to perform the publishing.

### Tag based repositories

For any other repository that doesn't need any special build but only tagging and merging, like PHP libraries, please use the command `repoRelease`. This command _must_ be run in the root directory of the repository.

```sh
cd path/to/my/repo
taoRelease repoRelease
```

You will be prompted to follow the instructions.

This command does:

- compute the next version from commits
- create a tag and a release

## Development

Remove the package if already installed globally :

```sh
npm uninstall -g @oat-sa/tao-extension-release
```

Then clone the sources :

```sh
git clone git@github.com:oat-sa/tao-extension-release.git
cd tao-extension-release
npm install
npm link
```

So the command `taoRelease` will use the sources.

Useful commands :

- `npm test` runs the test suite
- `npm run test:cov` runs the test suite with code coverage
- `npm run test:dev` runs the test suite in watch mode
- `npm run lint` verifies the sources complies with the code style guide

## Configuration

A file named `.tao-extension-release` is created in the user directory.
The following values can be defined in this file :

- `token` : your Github auth token
- `taoRoot` : the path to the root of TAO
- `wwwUser` : the system user used to launch PHP commands (`www-data`)

## Next version calculation

Next version taken based on [Conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/).
Some treats of the next version calculation:

- if one or more commits contains a breaking change, the version will be increased by one major semver version
- if one or more commits contains a feature change, the version will be increased by one minor semver version
- if one or more commits contains a bugfix change, the version will be increased by one fix semver version
- if no commit contains a conventional change information, the version will be increased by one fix semver version and warn the user
- if `release-version` option provided, it will be taken as next release version and version calculation will be skipped

## System Prerequisite

<a name="prerequisite"></a>

#### node.js

You need a recent version of [node.js](https://nodejs.org) for your platform.

#### git

You need to have the `git` > `1.7.0` command available in your `PATH`.

#### PHP

## Known Issues

### `Task foosass not found`
